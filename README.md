# JooHyuns Risk Map

The Risk Map is the Map of the Game Risk! A strategy board game where you fight your opponents with dice to win their countries.

The Risk Map is a simplified version of the World map with only 42 countries and six continents: Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The Risk Map allows the users to access the information (Continent and tax fees) of each country on the map and also allows them to find the shortest path/route between two countries (along with the ordered list of visited continents and also total cross-border taxes to pay).

Due to the fact that The Risk Game has a limited budget (it's apparently tough being a venue hire company), we will only design a terminal-driven interface for them. This means that the system will be controlled by a menu system that will be displayed on the terminal. The menu will allow users to select from a list of commands. The users can select a command by typing its code and any arguments it expects. Some commands require additional options, which are prompted by the system one at a time. The system will then execute the appropriate action. This was Programmed with Java.
